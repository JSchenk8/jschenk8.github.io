        <h3 className="margin-top-30">It's been a bit of a journey...</h3>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          After leaving school I briefly studied Medicine in Nottingham, UK. This wasn't for me, and
          I decided to pursue the only other thing I was any good at: climbing.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          Beginning out coaching and competing, I quickly transitioned to routesetting - creating
          indoor routes for walls around the UK and Europe. After some years, I was at a level to
          run competitions as a lead routesetting, managing other setters and mentoring junior team
          members. I also took on apprentices to create opportunities for others to learn the craft.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          It was in early 2015 having finished a year working fifty percent for a cycling events
          company, lead managing two of their largest events but ultimately looking for a new
          challenge, that two friends approached me about working with them in their small online
          climbing shop, by helping create and run a small retail space. This grew into a team of 10
          managing in- and out-stock of the warehouse, online orders and a bustling shop. The
          business was sold in 2019 and remains one of the biggest online climbing retail spaces in
          Europe.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          Whilst routesetting a competition I picked my camera up to take some photos of the
          athletes in the final. Posting the results online, the brand Berghaus approached me for
          photos of one of their athletes, which sparked the idea: What about taking pictures too?
          Balancing photography alongside routestting, coaching, managing the retail team and my
          hobbies was a difficult but rewarding challenge. I was fortunate to receive commercial
          work in cycling, climbing, motorcycling and small businesses complemented by wedding
          photography in the summer season.
        </p>
        <h3 className="margin-top-30">So Why Software?</h3>
        <p className="margin-top-30">
          All of this was well and good. But I was uninspired. I had turned my hobbies into my work
          and then was floating through my twenties working hard but not mentally challenged.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          I was looking for a change - I asked myself how I wanted to work? The answer was simple:
          People first, with a challenging environment in which I can learn, grow and contribute to
          a bigger picture.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          In need of a catalyst, my choice was removed from my with a diagnosis of cancer in 2017.
          Unable to work and beginning treatment, I decided to study. The following four years
          included two surgeries and 60 days of radiotherapy, during which I continued to work where
          possible and completed a degree in Mechanical Engineering, for which I was awarded First
          class honours.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          Inspired by my maths professor, I wrote a thesis on using computer vision to analyse the
          spin and velocity of moving objects using Matlab as a programming language. And as such,
          the spark was lit.
        </p>
        <p className="margin-top-20">
          Whilst teaching myself Python for computer vision and data-science I was recommended a
          software development bootcamp. One thing led to another, and I wrapped up 3 months of
          learning in Spring 2021, moved to Switzerland and begun work as a Solutions Engineer for
          Livingdocs AG.
